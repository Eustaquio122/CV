## Tiago Sousa

35 years old, Portuguese, living in London since 2015.

For a number of years, I have written films, directed films, edited films, helped others making their films, and taught people on how to make films.

Recently, I have decided to connect with an old passion and pick up where I left many years ago, when I switched from a Computer Science BSc to a BA in Film, and become a solid developer.
At the moment, my interests lie particularly in Functional Languages (especially Haskell), and roles that involve dealing with complex logic.
