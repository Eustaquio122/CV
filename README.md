## Tiago Sousa

35 years old, Portuguese, living in London since 2015.

For a number of years, I have written films, directed films, edited films, helped others making their films, and taught people on how to make films.

Recently, I have decided to connect with an passion and pick up where I left many years ago, when I switched from a Computer Science BSc to a BA in (yup) Film, and become a solid developer.
At the moment, my interests lie particularly on Functional Languages (especially Haskell) and roles that involve dealing with complex logic. But, being new to this area, I am quite open to possibilities.
