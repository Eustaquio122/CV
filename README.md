## Tiago Sousa

34 years old, Portuguese, living in London since 2015.
For a number of years, I have written films, directed films, edited films, helped others making their films, and taught people on how to make films.
Over the last two years, I have been easing up on the films thing, focusing exclusively on personal projects while, at the same time, learning and working on other areas of interest.
At the moment, I am looking to pick up where I left many years ago, when I switched from a Computer Science BSc to a BA in (yup) Film, and become a solid developer. Eventually, I am sure that it will all connect in some way, but at the moment my interests lie particularly in Games Development, Logic Programming, and Metaprogramming.

## Skills

#### Project Development

Over my 10 year experience in the Film industry, I have developed a high number of projects for fiction films, documentaries, tv series, music videos, and corporate videos.
During my time as Head of Development at Persona Non Grata Pictures, I was responsible for implementing a diverse slate of projects - some from my own ideas and initiative, others from strict client briefs - and subsequently managing the whole development process.
Aside from developing and managing, I actively worked on projects throughout the whole process, as a writer, director/assistant director, and editor. An example of this is the feature film "Embargo", which I wrote, worked on as an assistant director and edited. The film went on to be selected for and awarded prizes at a number of international film festivals, released in theatres in Portugal, Brazil, and the UK, and is still regularly aired on Portuguese and Brazilian TV:

#### Creative Thinking

Having worked many years in an industry such as film I think creativity is a given. But what I wish to emphasize with the term "Creative Thinking", is not only the ability to come up with imaginative and innovative ideas but also to do so in a thought process that successfully applies to a given context, being able to use new ideas to overcome challenges and make the best out of specific situations.
When I was directing my first short film, in 2009, I was informed by production that, due to budget constraints, we wouldn't be able to shoot the final scene of the movie, which took place on a train. I decided to adapt to what might be available, and rewrote the whole scene - at the end, the main character didn't depart on a train, but instead on a bike. This is what the poster for the film came to be: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1455614/mediaviewer/rm3235941632

#### Analytical Thinking

I have always loved abstract problems. From the 5th to the 12th grade, I came first at my school's maths olympics in all but one occasion. I like elegant and shrewd solutions - and problems that require them.
One aspect of my work in film, both as Head of Development and as a freelance script reader and editor, has been to analyse scripts and projects, assess its strengths and weaknesses, and either come up with solutions myself or help other people in identifying paths that can lead them to find creative and effective solutions.

#### Working with People

"Working with People" because I have not only a vast experience in working in teams, at different levels, as I have successfully worked with people from wide-ranging backgrounds.
Film shootings are done by large teams divided into a number of departments, each with very specific roles and responsibilities. As an intern, I have worked in some of these departments, under tight schedules and supervision. As an Assitant Director, I was responsible for the running of shootings, having to organise, lead, and coordinate all the departments.
Throughout my career, from my work in film through to my volunteering for a homeless charity and work as a Family Engagement Worker at a prison in London, I have worked with renowned actors, tv executives, funding and production parties from a number of different countries, people that found themselves homeless in the streets of London (struggling with chronic unemployment, mental health issues, and addiction) and prisoners - from people convicted of shoplifting to people convicted of murder.

#### Learning and Teaching

As a University Lecturer, I focused on helping the students in developing the projects they wanted to develop - they would propose a project, and we would then discuss it and redefine it, if needed, to fit the curricular goals. This required me to not only to be able to teach what I knew but, most often than not, having to research and learn new subjects and approaches to a standard that allowed me to provide guidance and tutoring to the students.
Throughout my volunteering and work as a Family Engagement Worker, between July 2016 and September 2017, I have seized every training opportunity that was available to me, having completed 18 different certified courses in subjects ranging from "Conflict Management" to "Abuse Related to Beliefs in Witchcraft".
